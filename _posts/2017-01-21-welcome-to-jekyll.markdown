Hello everyone! I’m Ruby developer and my current dream is to join [Github](https://github.com). Today I’ve made the first step on the way to my dream - I’ve started this blog.

As for me, I’ve set the bar high. Github is a big company with lots of professional developers, so I need to match Github needs. I plan to apply in 7 months (August 2017). It seems to be a big amount of time, but It’s NOT. In this period I must learn tons of new things. To track my progress, I’ll write articles to these blog, and I hope I’ll take some feedback from community. With me luck. Let’s go!
